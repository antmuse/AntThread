    * mechanism used to control access to a shared resource
    * in a concurrent (multi process) scenario.
    * Using the CAutoNamedLock class is the preferred way to automatically
    * lock and unlock a mutex.
    *
    * A CNamedMutex refers to a named operating system resource being the
    * unit of synchronization.
    * In other words, there can be multiple instances of CNamedMutex referring
    * to the same actual synchronization object.
    *
    * There should not be more than one instance of CNamedMutex for
    * a given name in a process. Otherwise, the instances may
    * interfere with each other.
